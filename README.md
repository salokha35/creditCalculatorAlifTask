# Credit calculator
This repository for storing and sharing the completed task, which was issued by Alif Bank, which is part of the recruitment process

The purpose of this task was to write code that would:
1. Depending on the product category and the term of the loan, the amount of the commission will be calculated
2. After the calculation sends an SMS message to the client with the details of the purchase

Both tasks were completed and they work correctly. 

But to improve it could be done (if there is additional time):
1. Log the entered data by the client
2. Improve validations for every input
3. Write tests

**P.s. For a full verification of SMS, please write to me so that I add your number to the list of verification numbers**
